Workaround to prevent repo re-index every 30s

The `update-packages` script which updates the helm repo index was confused
by the fact a file inside `charts/rstudio` changed but the last rstudio
tarball was created before this change.

We should make the logic a bit more robust or change approach but in the
meantime this workaround would prevent the re-build of the repo index.
